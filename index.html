            &nbsp &nbsp Hello! Name's Eli.<br><br>
            I'm a game developer and animator.<br>
            Or perhaps, "animator" is not the accurate word...<br> 
            I make animations <span>work</span>. I get them to do what they're
            intended for, and make it my mission to figure out why they don't, 
            when they don't.<br><br>
            ...and I'm a bit obsessed with adding flexibility and interaction to animations 
            using simulated physics and procedural rigs.<br>

                    Thankfully, our awesome artist already made the robot parts individually
                    enclosed and only weight-painted to their inner bones, so there
                    was no mesh stretching going on on separation.

                    While the artists were busy working on high-quality models, rigs, and animations, 
                    I put together a quick rig for our blockout model to be able to start testing 
                    gameplay mechanics with placeholder Mixamo animations.<br><br>
                    I bound and weight-painted it to a skeleton from Mixamo to make sure it's compatible.<br>
                    (Perhaps using their existing skeleton was unnecessary?.. Turns out Mixamo's auto-rigger 
                    is pretty smart)

            My team and I are currently working on a 3D action-adventure game <span>Spirit & Steel</span>.<br>
            In a few words:<br><br>
            Grandma with elemental powers vs. robots. <br><br>
            We are a team of 5 programmers (including myself), 9 artists, 3 designers, 
            and 1 music / audio specialist; we're building this game in Unreal Engine 5.<br> 
            My responsibility is to integrate artists' rigs and animations into gameplay,
            and to spice it up with some real-time physics and procedural motion.

                    During our graphics class, we were tasked with building a custom OpenGL renderer 
                    gradually throughout the semester. This is my version of the final project.<br><br>
                    The models were made by me in Blender, I just needed to write a Python script to 
                    export the vertices and faces into the format used by our framework.<br><br>
                    The project itself is written in C++ and uses OpenGL 4.3.

                    Active ragdoll (physical animation) in Unreal was somewhat straightforward to set 
                    up thanks to online tutorials, but trying to constrain body parts to environment 
                    initially caused the skeletal mesh to stretch excessively. No solutions found online.<br><br>
                    The issue was eventually resolved by tweaking the physics substep settings.
                    Look at him hang.<br><br>
                    This is intended for my personal parkour game project.<br>

                    First project that we've had so far in our current "Curves and Surfaces" math class: 
                    rendering a polynomial curve using De Casteljau's algorithm.<br>
                    Two alternative methods used for calculating the curve: recursive 
                    (Nested Linear Interpolation), and iterative (Bernstein Polynomial summation).<br><br>
                    Made in Godot Engine. <br>
                    While GDScript is not nearly as fast as C++, and initially caused 
                    stutter when used with recursive method, some simple memoization fixed that.<br>
                    For the upcoming projects (first of which will be rendering of Bezier curves), I 
                    intend to use GDExtension to write the performance-critical parts in C++.

                    After messing around with active ragdoll on the default Manny rig, I wanted to

                    skeletal mesh, made by me from scratch.<br><br>
                    I ended up creating... whatever the hell that thing is.
